  Type Safety
  Dart is a type safe language when you tell it a variable type is int you cant

  its not possible to later do

  myNumber = 50.7;

  it is not allowed

  Constants
  Dart has 2 different types of variables, they are decleared with 'const' 
  and 'final' keyword

  -Const Constants
  variables that their values can change areknown as mutable data.if you dont 
  want the value of your variable to be changed you use 'const' thus making 
  it immutable

  -Final Constants
  You know a variable has to be constant but the value has not been defined yet, 
  probably the value will be defined after the code has been running like 
  fetching data from API

E.g: final hoursSinceMidnight = DateTime.now().hour;
